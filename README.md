**HOW TO PLAY:**
  1. Claim your Secret Case. You will hold onto this case until the end of the game and you will not know the value until the game is over.
  2. Choose cases to be eliminated. Their value will be revealed immediately after you choose each one.
  3. After a few rounds, the Banker will offer you a buy out price, roughly based on the total value of the cases that are left.
    * If you enter `Deal` you accept the Banker's offer, revealing the amount in your Secret Case
    * If you enter `No Deal` the game will continue
  4. Keep going until you accept an offer or there are no more cases to open, at which point you will open your Secret Case.
  
  
  ***GOOD LUCK!!!***
